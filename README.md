# InternshipLog
Open source tool for logging internship hours.

Keep in mind this tool was made in a few hours so there most likly will be bugs you run into. I am 100% open to any PR requests from people using
the project that would like certain changes to be made. The export is in the correct format for GVSU CIS-490.

In order to locally run this project you will need to create a local instance of the database. 
https://www.gearhost.com/ is a very easy way to get a MSSQL database up and running at no cost.
